# Integration Testing Example

This example demonstrates how to write integration tests for your Bazel project.
It continues from setup demoed in the [proto gazelle](../004-proto-gazelle/README.md) example.

In this example, we will write integration tests for the echo service. Using `rules_itest`
we can start our echo server as a long running process on a random port and use it in our tests.

## Next

Now, move to the next [example](../007-hello-oci/README.md).
